Abstract

\end{center}
This report presents in detail the phases that have brought to the realization of a mobile, autonomous robot conceived to participate to the STI Robot Competition 2015 . This competitions aims to allow student at master level to come up with solutions, for a recycling robot for PET bottles collection and transport in a reserved area, dealing with the difficulties coming from a challenging environment where operate and test the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The participation to this competition, as fulfillment of the master’s semester project for our team, involved the complete design of the robotic system in every aspect from hardware to software allowing us to face all the usual challenges that are encountered through the achievement of such an accomplishment. The design of the mechanical parts has been coupled with the choice of sensors and actuators exploited by developing algorithms in order to achieve perception, actuation, navigation and localization tasks that gave to the robot the necessary skills to take part in the competition.
